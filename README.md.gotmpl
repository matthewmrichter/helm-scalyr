## Introduction

This helm chart installs the [Scalyr Agent monitor](https://app.scalyr.com/help/scalyr-agent) into a Kubernetes
cluster. It supports installing the agent with all features required to support a Kubernetes cluster monitoring.
Additionally, it can deploy Scalyr agents which monitor other parts of the infrastructure (for example a hosted
database service etc.).

This chart is not affiliated with Scalyr, Inc. in any way. For support, please open an issue in this
project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/dodevops/helm-scalyr/issues).

## Installation

Use

    helm install <name of release> scalyr-agent --repo https://dodevops.io/helm-scalyr

to install this chart.

## Configuration

Two basic configuration keys have to be set up to allow logging to Scalyr cloud:

* scalyr.server: The name of the Scalyr api server (defaults to scalyr.com)
* scalyr.apiKey: The api key used to authenticate to the Scalyr api server
* scalyr.config: The Scalyr configuration

The scalyr configuration is done using the
[configuration map approach](https://app.scalyr.com/help/scalyr-agent-k8s#modify-config). This is basically a key/value
hash. The keys refer to the configuration file name for grouping monitors. The value is the Scalyr json configuration
for each monitor.

This chart's default values are set to support the monitoring of a Kubernetes cluster. The only value you have
to set manually is:

* config.k8s.clusterName: name of the Kubernetes cluster to monitor (will be visible in the Scalyr UI)

If you want to monitor additional things outside of Kubernetes (e.g. Databases), you can set the following values:

* controllerType: For other monitors, it is usually best to set this to "deployment" instead of "daemonset"
* scalyr.k8s.enableLogs and scalyr.k8s.enableEvents: Set this to false to remove the serviceaccount, clusterroles and
  additional mounts to the Scalyr agent pods

## Controller type

By default, this chart creates a daemonset which is the recommended deployment pattern for Kubernetes monitoring.

If you'd like to create a different Scalyr agent, you can set `controllerType` to "deployment" and set
`scalyr.k8s.enableLogs` and `scalyr.k8s.enableEvents` to false.

## Development, CI/CD

On each push to master and other branches Github Actions workflow runs which performs basic helm
lint and helm install sanity checks against the changes.

[chart-testing](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing) wrapper is used for running helm lint and
helm install.

To run those checks locally, you need the following tools installed:

* helm 3
* chart-testing
* minikube (or kind cluster against which helm install can run)
* Python 3 with the following 3 libraries installed - yamllint, yamale

```bash
# 1. Install helm
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash

# 2. Install minikube
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

# 3. Install chart-testing
wget https://github.com/helm/chart-testing/releases/download/v3.4.0/chart-testing_3.4.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzvf chart-testing_3.4.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv ct /usr/local/bin
sudo mv etc ~/.ct

# 4. Create Python virtualenv and install libraries needed by chart testing
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install yamale yamllint

# 5. Start minikube Kubernetes cluster
minikube start

# 6. Run actual lint and install task
ct lint --debug --charts . --chart-dirs "$(pwd)"

# To use valid API key
mkdir -p ci/
echo -e 'scalyr:\n  apiKey: "SCALYR_TEST_WRITE_API_KEY"' > ci/test-values.yaml

ct install --debug --charts . --chart-dirs "$(pwd)"
```

As an alternative to manually installing those tools and setting up the environment, you can also
use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) tool which allows you to run GHA workflow locally inside
Docker containers as shown below.

```bash
act lint_test
act
```

Keep in mind that it may take a while since it needs to pull down a large Docker image during the
first run. This tool also may not work correctly on some operating systems since it relies on
Docker inside Docker functionality for creating kind Kubernetes cluster.
